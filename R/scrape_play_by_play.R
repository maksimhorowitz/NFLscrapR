#' Scrape an individual game's play-by-play data from NFL.com
#' 
#' Depending on the year and type of the given game id, this function returns
#' the play-by-play data available from NFL.com from either JSON (games starting
#' in 2009) or parsed HTML (regular and post-season games starting in 1998, 
#' pre-season games starting in 2000). The necessary info regarding the game's 
#' play-by-play data to be scraped (type and season) is provided by the 
#' \code{\link{scrape_game_ids}} function. In addition to all of the play-level data
#' provided by the NFL, outputs from the `nflscrapR` expected points and win 
#' probability models are also included, allowing an individual to conduct their
#' own analysis with more advanced football statistics. A detailed description 
#' of the models methodologies can be found here: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998}.
#' This function acts as a wrapper function for the 
#' \code{\link{scrape_json_play_by_play}} and \code{\link{scrape_html_play_by_play}} 
#' functions, deciding which to use depending on the input.
#' 
#' @param game_id Ten digit game id (either numeric or character) associated 
#' with a given NFL game.
#' @param type String indicating the type of game, must either be: "pre", 
#' "reg", or "post". This argument is required for entry to ensure proper 
#' handling of the type of play-by-play data for the given game.
#' @param season Numeric 4-digit year associated with an NFL season for the given
#' game id. 
#' @param check_url Indicator for whether or not to check if the game's url 
#' exists (default is 1, meaning yes). This is used to work with the 
#' \code{\link{scrape_season_play_by_play}} function that will perform its own
#' check prior to scraping individual games.
#' @return Data frame where each individual row represents a single play in 
#' the game containing detailed information depending on the availability of 
#' data for the game. See \code{\link{scrape_json_play_by_play}} and 
#' \code{\link{scrape_html_play_by_play}} for documentation about the 
#' columns returned.

#' Scrape season play-by-play for a given NFL season (either pre, regular, or post-season) 
#' 
#' Depending on the year and type of the given game id, this function returns
#' the play-by-play data available from NFL.com from either JSON (games starting
#' in 2009) or parsed HTML (regular and post-season games starting in 1998, 
#' pre-season games starting in 2000). The necessary info regarding the game's 
#' play-by-play data to be scraped (type and season) is provided by the 
#' \code{\link{scrape_game_ids}} function. In addition to all of the play-level data
#' provided by the NFL, outputs from the `nflscrapR` expected points and win 
#' probability models are also included, allowing an individual to conduct their
#' own analysis with more advanced football statistics. A detailed description 
#' of the models methodologies can be found here: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998}.
#' This function acts as a wrapper function for calling the 
#' \code{\link{scrape_game_play_by_play}} function over all of the games meeting
#' the criteria of the user's input.
#' 
#' @param season Numeric 4-digit year associated with an NFL season
#' @param type String indicating the type of game play-by-play, must either be
#' "pre", "reg", or "post" (default is "reg").
#' @param weeks Numeric vector indicating which weeks of preseason (0 to 4 except
#' for 2011 season without Hall of Fame game) or regular season games (1 to 17)
#' to grab (default value of NULL corresponds to selecting all available weeks).
#' @param teams String vector indicating which teams (based on the abbreviation)
#' the function should grab game info for (default value of NULL corresponds to
#' selecting all available teams).
#' @return Data frame where each individual row represents a single play in 
#' the game containing detailed information depending on the availability of 
#' data for the game. See \code{\link{scrape_json_play_by_play}} and 
#' \code{\link{scrape_html_play_by_play}} for documentation about the 
#' columns returned.
#' @examples
#' # Scrape the play-by-play data for the 2017 Super Bowl by first getting all
#' # of the post-season game ids then use the required info to scrape the

#' playoff_game_ids_17 <- scrape_game_ids(2017, type = "post")
#' sb_17_id <- playoff_game_ids_17$game_id[nrow(playoff_game_ids_17)]
